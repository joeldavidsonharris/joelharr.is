            JobMatcha - brewing a better job hunt
        </p>
        <div class="margin post-body" style="flex-direction: column">
            <p class="post-section" style="margin-top: 1rem;">The background</p>
            <p>JobMatcha is my first attempt at a full-stack website. It came about in January 2025 when I was moving to Australia. I quit my job in New Zealand and was looking for something in Australia.</p>
            <p>I found the whole process needlessly manual. The issue was that I knew what I wanted, but I couldn’t effectively filter jobs based on that. A lot of the important information was only available when reading the whole job advert.</p>
            <p>I liken it to Tinder – imagine if, instead of Tinder matches, you were provided with random profiles and had to search each one to see if you were really a match. You probably wouldn't use it for very long.</p>
            
            <img class="post-image" src="/images/general/job-matcha-running.png"/>
            <p class="post-image-subtext">Searching for job matches in JobMatcha</p>

            <p>I wanted job matches that came to me, and so, JobMatcha was born. You input your experience and what you’re looking for; it scrapes Seek, reads the job ads, and matches against your input.</p>
            
            <img class="post-image" src="/images/general/job-matcha-match.png"/>
            <p class="post-image-subtext" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">A job match. You can click the seek logo to apply</p>

            <p class="post-section">The technical</p>
            <p>Once I had it working locally, I needed to make it accessible to others. I had never worked on any real front-end, so I did what any good back-end engineer does and served my front-end from my back-end API:</p>
            
            <img class="post-image" src="/images/general/job-matcha-architecture.png"/>
            <p class="post-image-subtext">And overview of the architecture</p>

            <p>I got a domain name (<a href="www.jobmatcha.org">jobmatcha.org</a>), hosted it on Digital Ocean (for about five dollars a month), and hooked it up to GitHub so that it would automatically update whenever I publish code changes.</p>

            <p class="post-section">The learnings</p>
            <p>Ultimately, this was a learning exercise. I wanted to go through the motions of making a product, to give myself a baseline understanding and to feel some of the pain that motivates a better approach.</p>
            <p class="post-sub-section">The good</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Learned how to get domains, get hosting, and deploy</li>
            <li>Learned more JavaScript, CSS, and HTML</li>
            <li>Learned some Flask and API stuff</li>
            <li>Used a lot of generative AI-enhanced workflows for the front-end code</li>
            <li>Nice colours, nice branding</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="post-sub-section">The bad</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Building on top of an unsupported API is not very smart – every time Seek updates their front-end my service breaks</li>
            <li>I found it too taxing for the time saved
                <ul>
                <li>I needed to essentially rewrite my CV to save looking at around 20 job listings on a single platform</li>
                <li>Most of the “advanced search” use cases are already covered by Seek’s existing search system</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>It has no clear path to monetisation</li>
            <li>It has high costs that scale with usage
                <ul>
                <li>Want to avoid large usage-based costs until I am happy committing capital</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Designing a product as I’m building it is hard</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="post-sub-section">For next time</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Spend a bit of time doing directed research and design prior to building
                <ul>
                <li>Things to understand:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Market size</li>
                    <li>Competition</li>
                    <li>Ability to scale</li>
                    <li>Monetisation</li>
                    <li>How to reach users</li>
                    <li>Is there a network effect involved?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Things to design:
                    <ul>
                    <li>User journey</li>
                    <li>Wireframes</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Use a front-end framework such as Next.js
                <ul>
                <li>This can hopefully speed up UI development time once the learning curve is over</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Build monetisation into the next product
                <ul>
                <li>Need practice integrating Stripe</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
