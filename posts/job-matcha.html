            JobMatcha: brewing a better job hunt experience
        </p>
        <div class="margin post-body" style="flex-direction: column">
            <p class="post-section" style="margin-top: 1rem;">The background</p>
            <p>JobMatcha is my first attempt at a full-stack website. It came about in January 2025 when I was moving to Australia. I quit my job in New Zealand and was looking for something new.</p>
            <p>I found the whole process needlessly manual. I knew what I wanted, but I couldn’t effectively filter jobs based on that. A lot of the important information was only available when reading the whole job advert.</p>
            <p>I liken it to Tinder – imagine if, instead of Tinder matches, you were provided with random profiles and had to search each one to see if you were really a match. You probably wouldn't use it for very long.</p>
            
            <img class="post-image" src="/images/general/job-matcha-running.png"/>
            <p class="post-image-subtext">Searching for job matches in JobMatcha</p>

            <p>I wanted job matches that came to me, and so, JobMatcha was born. You input your experience and what you’re looking for; it scrapes Seek, reads the job ads, and matches against your input.</p>
            
            <img class="post-image" src="/images/general/job-matcha-match.png"/>
            <p class="post-image-subtext" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">A job match. You can click the seek logo to apply</p>

            <p class="post-section">The technical</p>
            <p>Once I had it working locally, I needed to make it accessible to others. I had never worked on any real front-end, so I did what any good back-end engineer does and served my front-end from my back-end API:</p>
            
            <img class="post-image" src="/images/general/job-matcha-architecture.png"/>
            <p class="post-image-subtext">An overview of the architecture</p>

            <p>I got a domain name (<a href="https://www.jobmatcha.org">jobmatcha.org</a>), hosted it on Digital Ocean (for about five dollars a month), and hooked it up to GitHub so that it would automatically update whenever I publish code changes.</p>

            <p class="post-section">The learnings</p>
            <p>Ultimately, this was a learning exercise. I wanted to go through the motions of making a product to give myself a baseline understanding, and to feel some of the pain that motivates a better approach.</p>

            <p class="post-sub-section">The good</p>
            <p>I learned a lot, in particular:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>How to get a domain, organise hosting, and deployment</li>
            <li>More JavaScript, CSS, and HTML</li>
            <li>API best practices when supporting a front-end</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some things I think worked out well:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Used a lot of generative AI-enhanced workflows for the front-end code</li>
            <li>Nice colours and branding</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="post-sub-section">The bad</p>
            <p>Building on top of an unsupported API is not very smart – every time Seek updates their front-end my service breaks. This removes any possibility of monetisation in the future as no-one is willing to pay for a product that breaks often and without warning <em>(except for GCP customers)</em>.</p>
            <p>The actual product was not great when using it more than once. Each time you opened it you needed to fill out your details again.</p>
            <p>I didn’t do enough research into what the incumbent platforms were capable of: most of the “advanced search” use cases are already covered by Seek’s existing search system.</p>
            <p>Some other things:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>It has high costs that scale with usage</li>
            <li>Designing a product as I’m building it is hard</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="post-sub-section">For next time</p>
            <p>Next time I want to apply my learnings to make something useful that I can monetise. My goal with my next project is to get a single paying customer.</p>
            <p>I will implement directed research and design prior to building.</p>
            <p>Things to research:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Market size</li>
            <li>Competition</li>
            <li>Ability to scale</li>
            <li>Monetisation</li>
            <li>How to reach users</li>
            <li>Is there a network effect involved?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Things to design:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>User journey</li>
            <li>Wireframes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I want to improve my technical stack for anything more complex. I can’t avoid front-end development forever. Next time I’ll use a front-end framework such as Next.js. I’ll also use Stripe to build in the monetisation.</p>
            <p>Overall it was a great project and I learned a lot. It showed me where my knowledge is lacking, and some of the barriers that are not obvious when you get started (unless you do the research!).</p>
